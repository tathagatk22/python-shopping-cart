### Problem Statement

You have to build a CLI (Command Line Interface) based E-commerce app called MyCart which has
the following 2 flows.

#### User Flow:
- Users should be able to view the list of multiple categories.
- Users should be able to view all the products under a particular category.
- Users should be able to view product details.
- Users should be able to add products to Cart.
- Users should be able to buy multiple products from the Cart.
- Users should be able to remove products from the Cart.
- If the final billing amount is greater than Rs 10,000 then Rs 500 OFF should be given to the user.
- If the final billing amount is less than Rs 10,000 then no discount should be given to the user.
- Bill should be generated for multiple product purchases showing the actual amount, discounted amount, and the final amount.

#### Admin Flow:
- Admin should be able to add categories and products.
- Admin should be able to see details of the products added to the cart by the user.
- Admin should be able to see all the bills generated by all the users.

#### Rules:
- No frameworks.
- You can use relational databases.
- You cannot use frameworks but can use libraries/tools/gems/packages for building, testing etc..
- It should be a CLI App.
- You can choose any language of your choice(Python, Java, Ruby, Golang, JS/TS, Kotlin).
- Writing Tests is mandatory.
- You can assume things if things are not clear to you.
